# azr

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Adrien, I currently work on the Packer team at HashiCorp.

## Here are some things about me:

* I like learning and variety. I have previously worked on embedded systems, a social network, video games, geolocation software, perceptual image hashing, web, big data, devops and devops tools.
* I love open source and working on open source software. It makes me feel like my work is going to survive. But what I love most here is feeling that the work I do is used and helpful; and to improve it.
* I really like Go, and come from a C/C++ background/school. I taught myself Go over a weekend back in December 2014 and got my first go job after contributing to a few open source projects. I have been working with Go ever since. I wouldn't mind learning new languages at all though. I'd love to C/C++ too.
* I have many values, but these days, I try to put first empathy, kindness, communications and beautiful work; and if we can sprinkle some fun on top of that, I'm going to be quite happy.
* I'm really close to what you could describe as ADHD and also quite sensitive.
* Outside of work I love traveling, dancing, and spending time with my family.
* Fun fact, I used to live on a sailboat as a kiddo with my familly. It pretty much looked like this one: â›µ. In general, I really enjoy the freedom and travelling. But not in a _visit a country for 2 weeks and then go somewhere else_ kind of way; More in a _live there for a few months to a few years_ manner.
